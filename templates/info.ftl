        <p>Hello and welcome to my blog. My name is Alex and I am a software engineer. I like to explore how life works by consuming quality content, exercising and travelling.</p>
        <p>I am not afraid of failure because everything is a learning experience. I share my views on the world (and sometimes programming) as an outlet of sorts and a way to formalize my thoughts. Bringing clarity to someone's mind out there will make me very happy, of course.</p>
