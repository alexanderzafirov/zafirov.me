Searching for right place

[//]: # "__PREVIEW__"

Here I am again. In the past month I have had my _don't care_ hat on quite low. My pink glasses are in my pockeet 
and I am ready to put them on for the next couple of weeks. Yup - I'm starting a new job. A familiar feeling that
never actually gets old. It's a transition of sorts, a closing of a chapter if you will.

I start to reminisce about the thoughts and experiences I had - joy, anger, happiness, frustration, sence of accomplishment ... all of that.
I think about what lead to the switch, how I got throught the interview process and where it got me in the end.
A pause. And more questions - what about my colleagues, what about the people I don't know in the new place. What about the money?
Yes, the money. That they that every manager avoids, every employee likes to boast about in private but shrivels to mention
when the time comes. The money. What about the commute time? What about the perks? It's just crazy how many things go 
into choosing a decision. 

That comes to no suprise, of course. In modern day societies people spend the majority of their waking time at work.
And that is a big commitment to make.
