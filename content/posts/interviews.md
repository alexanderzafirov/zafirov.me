I have experience with interviews both from the interviewer and interviewee's side. 
The first comes from the fact that I was given the opportunity to design the technical part of the interview process at a former employer. 
The latter due to me having an average stay of 1.5 - 2 years at any given company I was part of.
Hence, I have seen most of it - tasks, tests, assignments, code challenges, questions, white board drawings, etc.
Thinking of this a mental Q&A session arouse in my mind:

> Q: What is the purpose of it all?
>
> A: Obviously to hire the best person that fits the criteria.
>
> Q: Good. How do you come up with a list of requirements?
>
> A: You base it on the in-house knowledge and experience, and/or you look at industry standards.
>
> Q: Ok. How do you assess that a given candidate covers the necessary criteria for the job?
>
> A: There are many ways.

The various ways of carrying out a technical interview is the topic of this essay.
