Developers across the globe are aspiring to be recognized as *senior*.
Companies are making job postings with the primary goal of recruiting talent with flamboyant titles 
such as "Lead", "Architect", "Specialist". 
That being said seniority in software engineering is a dubious term. 
It packs many concepts into one, creating a murky and opaque mask. 
For years, I have been interested in answering questions like "What makes up a senior software engineer?", 
"Are there varying degrees of being a senior?" and "Once you become a senior are you still junior at something?". 
In this essay I will share my thoughts in an attempt to peel away the layers of this overloaded term, 
and the accidental complexity that it has accumulated.

## Why
Before we dive into explanations it is worth understanding how the two parties - the employee and employer - benefit
from having senior staff on board.

### Developers
Becoming a senior software engineer is primarily associated with trust. 
I have observed that companies tend to "elevate" their employees after a several years of productive work without
any major hiccups. On the perk side salary increase is an obvious gain.
This seems to hold true especially for outsourced recruits. 
Other than that having "senior" in front of the rest of your job title represents 
a certain level of experience (more on that later) that you bring in. 
Hence, during a discussion it is expected of senior folk to drive the conversation and help others get the right amount of
technical knowledge they need so that the correct steps forward can be made.

### Companies
Employing people deemed "senior" seems like a no-brainer. They are more of everything - they know more, have more experience,
have seen the evolution of project A or software B. However, they are also more opinionated, carry more mental baggage
and more maintenance (read higher salaries and benefits). Through observations, I found that employers favor a good mix of
50/50 up to 30/70 in favor more junior colleagues. That way there could be several key drivers to a bigger fleet of 
young, energetic, rising starts.

## Definition
Seniority is replicable knowledge correctly applied to a relevant problem. 
To argue that this statement holds I will unravel each of the building blocks behind this definition
in a set of interconnected topics starting at its core.

## Knowledge
There are two key components to being a senior software engineer. One of them is knowledge. 
Furthermore, it has to be *practical* knowledge that is *relevant* to the problem at hand. 

## Experience
The counterpart to knowledge is experience. 

## Communication

## Ownership

## Transparency

## Inclusion

## Encouragement

## Business impact

## Stakeholder management
