In my career I had various colleagues that carried the word "senior" as part of their job title.
Others used fancier alternatives such as "Specialist", "Expert", "Master". 
Those people were quite different in their knowledge, technical skills and attitude towards teammates to name a few.
Having interacted with them for prolonged durations I observed that their interpretation of the title varies widely.
It seems to pack many concepts into one, creating a buzz-word with questionable added value.

Questions like "What makes up a senior software engineer?", 
"Are there varying degrees of being a senior?" and "Once you become a senior are you still junior at something?" seem to find answers 
only when salary negotiations come into play.

In this essay I will share my thoughts on the matter in an attempt to peel away the layers of this overloaded term, 
and the accidental complexity that it has accumulated.

## Why "Seniority"
Before we dive into definitions it is worth answering two important questions.

> Why do software engineers want to be senior?

The simplest answers that come to mind:
- higher salary and more perks
- greater job flexibility
- more weight on what they say
- harder problems to tackle
- offload repetitive tasks to junior colleagues

Depending on the company you work for these items may or may not be relevant.
It is interesting to see, though, how this list intersects with the constituents of *seniority* described later on in the essay.

> Why do companies want to employ senior software engineers?

Employing people deemed "senior" seems like a no-brainer. Among others:
- they know more
- have more experience
- have seen the evolution of project A or software B
- can mentor colleagues
- can manage stakeholders

However, they are also more opinionated, carry more mental baggage and are more maintenance (read higher salaries and benefits). 
Therefore, a tradeoff needs to be made.
Through observations, I found that employers favor a mix of around 30/70 in favor of junior colleagues. 
That way there could be several key drivers to a bigger fleet of young, energetic, rising starts.

## Definition
Seniority is replicable knowledge correctly applied to a relevant problem. 
To argue that this statement holds I will unravel each of the building blocks behind this definition
in a set of interconnected topics starting at the core.

## Knowledge and experience
There are two key components to being a senior software engineer - knowledge and experience.
You could say there is a duality between the two.
Working on something gives you experience with it. 
The more you exercise it, the deeper the knowledge you develop in the given subject.

If we go into subsections, there is positive and negative experience. 
We learn from both, yet negative experiences always leave a more lasting imprint on us.
So testing the limits of their knowledge is the mark of a senior software engineer.

Knowledge in itself can be further broken down in two:
- domain knowledge - understanding of the way the world you are modeling software after works
- technical knowledge - understanding how technology able to solve abstract problems works

The intersection of the two is the ultimate goal for every software engineer.
The level at which you apply both kinds of knowledge makes gives the s

the importance of the knowledge you have of technology in general diminishes with time,
giving way to the ability to quickly navigate a certain project, and the way it models a certain domain.
This is unfortunate as the two primary jobs of a software engineer is to make new software and maintain existing solutions.
Sad say but non-technical people relate only to existing solutions generating revenue - hence the discrepancy.
To get that knowledge you can study hard and follow logical reasoning. 
However, nothing can substitute professional experience.

The counterpart to knowledge is experience. 

In my eyes there are two things that allow employees to ascend the ladder towards seniority:

- team play - your ability to gel well with the rest of the pack on a personal level 

Put another way - becoming a senior software engineer in an organization is primarily associated with trust. Afterwards comes technical prowess.
