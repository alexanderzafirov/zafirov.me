Seniority in software engineering is a dubious term. It packs many concepts in one place creating a ubiquitous and 
opaque mask. For years, I have been interested in answering questions like
"What makes up a senior software engineer?", "Are there varying degrees of seniority once you become one?" 
and "Once you become a senior can you go back to being a junior?". 
In this essay I share my findings and suggestions on how to navigate the accidental complexity that the industry has
created.
