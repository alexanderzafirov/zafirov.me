Hello and welcome to "Experiencing side effects". My name is Alex and I will be taking you on a journey through my thought process.

I am a software engineer by profession but am keenly interested in the way the world works. 
You can say that I want to learn about life in general so that I can leave things better than I found them. 
My approach relies on consuming quality content, exercise and travel.

"Experiencing side effects" is all about the nitty-gritty details of the reality that surrounds us.
Here you will find essays based on my personal experience in the software industry as well as my life across the planet.
My pursuit towards mastery is the primary drive for this blog.
