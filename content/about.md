Hello and welcome to my blog. My name is Alex and I am a software engineer. I like to explore how life works by consuming quality content, exercising and travelling.

I am not afraid of failure because everything is a learning experience. I use this space to share my views of the world and sometimes programming as an outlet of sorts. It aslo helps me formalize my thoughts. Bringing clarity to your mind, dear reader, will make me very happy.
