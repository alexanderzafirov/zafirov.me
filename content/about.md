Welcome to "./side_effects.sh" (read execute the _side_effects_ shell script). 
My name is Alex and I will be taking you on a journey through my thought process.

I am a software engineer by profession but am keenly interested in the way the world works. 
You can say that I want to learn about life in general so that I can leave things better than I found them. 
My approach relies on consuming quality content, exercise and travel.

"./side_effects.sh" is all about the nitty-gritty details of the reality that surrounds us.
Here you will find essays based on my personal experience in the software industry as well as my life across the planet.
My pursuit towards mastery is the primary drive for this blog. 
As I continue to discover the hidden complexity in my day-to-day, I will try to formalize my learnings in an eloquent and thorough manner.
The occasional code snippet may pop here and there to emphasize the duality between hard and soft skills.
