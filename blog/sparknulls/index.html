		<p>Let's make it a Scala-ble XMAS</p>
<p>Today we are discussing User Defined Functions (UDF) in Spark.</p>
<p>Sometimes the simplest things are hardest to work out. Let's say I have a <code>DataFrame</code> created from a parquet file which can have nullable columns that are of a certain type - in this example that is <code>Int</code>. The reason I chose <code>Int</code> particularly is that it is <em>not a trivial</em> case i.e. it doesn't accept <code>null</code>s as values. The problem that arises is that the <code>DataFrame</code> can have <code>IntegerType</code> specified for the schema and still contain <code>null</code>s. I need to think of something that reflects the fact that I'm getting <code>Int</code> and <code>null</code> in the same type or else I will get a runtime exception for wrong input type. Tackling this is the goal of this post. On a side note - <code>String</code> is <em>trivial</em> since it works with nulls - no need for magic there.</p>
<p>The first solution to the problem is super ugly. I don't like it but it works. I know that the following could be done with an implicit but I don't like them since they are hard to trace in a bigger code base.</p>
<p>The first step is to set the input of the UDF to be <code>Any</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="scala">def foo: (Any =&gt; Int) = (a: Any) =&gt; toInt(a) / 100000

val toFoo = udf(foo)
</code></pre>
<p>After that the most important thing happens in the <code>toInt</code> function. Since I have a val of type <code>Any</code> that may contain a <code>null</code>, I wrap that in an <code>Option</code>. After that I proceed to set a default value. Since I'm specifying Int and Any as types, the compiler will try and resolve the first common type in the type tree - that is <code>Any</code> - I need to cast the result to <code>Int</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="scala">def toInt(v: Any): Int = Option(v).getOrElse(0).asInstanceOf[Int]
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="scala">val outDf = dfParquet
    .withColumn(&quot;foo_column&quot;, toFoo(&#39;a))
    .select(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;foo_column&quot;)
    .show()
</code></pre>
<p>Phew! As I said this is not bullet-proof. The reason is that I use <code>Any</code>, I've opened the door to all types so if I pass a String, let's say, the <code>asInstanceOf</code> will fail during execution.</p>
<p>Luckily the solution is quite simple. Just use Java's <code>Integer</code> boxed primitive. It is a perfect candidate for the case. This means no conversions from <code>Any</code>, no opening of Pandora's Any box. If you need to make better sense of the <code>null</code> value you can leverage on the <code>Option</code> class.</p>
<pre><code class="scala">def foo: (Integer =&gt; Option[Integer]) = (i: Integer) =&gt; Option(i).map(_ + 1)
</code></pre>
