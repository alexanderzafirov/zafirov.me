		<p>As seen through the eyes of one</p>
<p>Developers, software engineers, coders. Many names that in all honesty refer to the same persona. But what do these people do all day? Why are they in such high demand? Why do they get so high salaries all around the world? Why don't they conform to the norms that people laid out for many years? I will attempt to answer these and other questions in this post of mine. Let's start from the top.</p>
<h2>Why is there software development?</h2>
<p>Fundamental question, in my opinion. As species ever since we figured how to make tools, grow crops, build shelter and refridgerate food - basically taking care of the bottom of Maslow's pyrimad - we wanted do things faster, better and in larger quantities. Fast-forward to 20th century and you will see that many of our problems transitioned to being mechanical and then digital. Thus in its essence software development tackles the problem of automation of tasks and needs that are or aren't apparent to the general public.</p>
<h2>What do developers do?</h2>
<p>As the job title suggests - they develop. What do they develop? <em>Software</em>. Ok, but what is the process of developing software? Now we are getting somewhere. Well, like any other job software development follows steps - or even fancier words like <em>methodologies</em> - that companies have given names to e.g. Agile development, SCRUM, KANBAN. Throw away all that cruft and you are left with something like: 1) Identify the task/problem/need 2) Describe it in sufficient detail so that you don't need to think about the problem when you are implementing it (I'll get to that a bit later) 3) Allocate resources/minions/worker bees/developers 4) Let them do their thing 5) Review what has been done/delivered 6) Repeat</p>
<p>What I described here is from the perspective of someone working as a part of an organization. Now if we are talking about developing from the perspective of the developer himself then we get a different picture: 1) Find/get/receive a task to work on 2) Choose a technology to implement that task in 3) Come up with a solution - this step can be merged in step 4 but that is discouraged as you need to keep multiple things in your mind at the same time - the specifications of the task you are trying to solve and the actual details of how the technology you have chosen works. More often that not that is way too much. 4) Implement that solution - this is where work gets really done 5) Test your work - see if it actually behaves as you expect it to 6) Reiterate until your satisfied</p>
<p>What I have described above is actually not exhaustive. In a team setting you have people with different set of competances. Whenever someone wants to change something in your system - that is the whole big thing that constitutes multiple people's effort over many years - you need to have the approval of multiple people. Primarily because they can spot your mistakes better than you and get suggest things you might have missed. And added benefit is that explaining your thoughts in a written or verbal form will force you to synthesize what you now to something easy to understand which will allow you to realize to what extent you are familiar with a given subject.</p>
<p>Taking into account what I wrote so far, I will have to disappoint you dear reader since we are still not done. As a developer in a company - depending, of course, if you are a consultant/contractor/etc. or a full-time employee - you need to not only augment/expand/add to the existing system but you need to maintain that. Bugs - problems </p>
