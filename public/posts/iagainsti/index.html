      <p>I have enjoyed physical activity from a very early age. Since I was blessed with being a child of the pre-computer era I spent my free time outside on the street, playing with my peers. I clearly remember the endless summer days when I was chasing a football with my legs covered in black and blue spots from all the falls they had to bear. While competing against other players I came to know what it means to win and lose. I also realized that it takes dedication to pursue your goals. It was simple — some people trained more than others. I learned to pay respect to hard work and appreciate that type of mentality. I’m talking about that awesome moment when you defeat a worthy opponent who is giving it everything they got. Or when you lose to someone who was better but beat you fair and square. I find the latter case even gratifying since it shows you your weaknesses and gives you something to work on.</p>
<p>In general looking back at these great childhood memories I find that they gave me the competitiveness, teamwork mentality and the drive that I use today as part of my motivation when facing difficulties.</p>
<p>I asked a friend once what he thought of me and our friendship and he said “You always find a path towards your goal. Slowly but surely you practice day after day at you own pace.” It was humbling to hear these words yet I believe that this mindset didn’t come over night. I always perceived challenges as something that is part of my life and as something that I have to enjoy rather then despise. This goes from sports and translates to every task I’m faced with.</p>
<p>Through the years I have gone through different training programs and sports. Each and everyone of them gave me something I incorporated in the way I live. Here is what I learned:</p>
<h3 id="karate">Karate</h3>
<ul>
<li>respect your teachers and your elders — when you enter the dojo use your teachers as your guidance from ignorance to enlightenment</li>
<li>work hard to achieve excellence — it takes hours upon hours to get a kata right with the proper posture, strength, balance and spirit</li>
<li>stay humble no matter how well you excel — it was a moment I will not forget. As the summer was nearing none of the other students were in the dojo so it was only me and the two sensei. I was doing a kata in front of them and they congratulated me for coming from a newbie half a year ago to being able to perform the kata well. I was happy yet aimed to be humble.</li>
<li>ve ready every single day — unlike professional athletes that demonstrate their abilities for a limited amount of time at a given day, karate requires the students to be ready all the time</li>
<li>be at peace with yourself — learning to learn from your mistakes, accept feedback and continue to improve is the true way to mastery</li>
</ul>
