      <description>If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the concept of being (in the) present, let me quickly bring you up to speed. We lead our daily lives stormed by visual stimuli. They bombard us at every step from the moment we go out into the real or the digital world. That is slowly starting to wear people down. The reason is that from an evolutionary standpoint the increased amount of visual signals make us more alert and push us in fight-or-flight mode.</description>
