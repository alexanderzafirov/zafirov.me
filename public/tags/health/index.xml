      <description>As a person doing an primarily sitting type of job I am sure you will relate to some of the following health issues:
 eye strain lower back pain wrist pain headaches reduced mobility trouble falling asleep etc.  Depending on which part of the world you live in, office working conditions may or may not be viewed as a contributor to these things. I am lucky to be part of a society where these things matter and people are conscientious about their health.</description>
