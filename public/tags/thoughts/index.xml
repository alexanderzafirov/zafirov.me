      <title>Staying present</title>

      <description>If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the concept of being (in the) present, let me quickly bring you up to speed. We lead our daily lives stormed by visual stimuli. They bombard us at every step from the moment we go out into the real or the digital world. That is slowly starting to wear people down. The reason is that from an evolutionary standpoint the increased amount of visual signals make us more alert and push us in fight-or-flight mode.</description>

      <title>Goodbye cruel Facebook world I&#39;m leaving you today</title>

      <description>Before I write this I want to assure you that this is no plead for attention. For anyone that has been a part of my contacts on the aforementioned social network - you would know that I am mainly reposting articles that I read. So in a sense I use FB as another way to store articles.
The other day I was talking to a friend and he said &amp;ldquo;Man, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna leave this shit one day soon&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip; already! But why is that? To answer that question first let me walk you through my year.
As is obvious I haven&amp;rsquo;t written much in 2017 and that is for a reason. I traveled, I faced obstacles and learned a lot of lessons from my mistakes. If 2016 was a year of changes then 2017 was that and some more so I name the last 12 months - a year of challenges.</description>

      <title>2016 - A Year Of Changes</title>

      <description>2016 was a rough year. Everywhere you look you see turmoil. Brexit, Trump, Syria, Nice, Berlin, Migrants, &amp;hellip; And here comes a question - has this world been in a tougher spot? Of course. An we have always persevered. How? By being human!
I will come back to this thought but first let me take you through my 2016. It was also full of highs and lows. Fortunately for me it peaked in mainly positive outcomes.</description>

      <description>I share with you some thoughts on a part of my life that I hold very dear to me and has kept me going through my toughest of times.
I have enjoyed physical activity from a very early age. Since I was blessed with being a child of the pre-computer era I spent my free time outside on the street, playing with my peers. I clearly remember the endless summer days when I was chasing a football with my legs covered in black and blue spots from all the falls they had to bear.</description>

      <title>Trip to Rajasthan, India</title>
      <link>http://alexanderzafirov.github.io/zafirov.me/post/trip_rajastan/</link>

      <description>I recently visited the Rajasthan state in India and, boy, was it a memorable experience. In this post I’d like to share my experiences and hopefully help out somebody that is planning a trip to this funky place.
The reason for which I headed to India in the first place was that my girlfriend was invited to a wedding. Honestly I had no idea of what to expect. After some google-ing I found out that Indian weddings last for days and are a sight to see.</description>

      <title>Life - an Interstellar aftermath</title>

      <description>I guess it has been some years now. Unlike many of my peers I believe I have started thinking about “life” from an early age. It was for some long forgotten reason that I realized around the age of 12 that I am going to die one day. Such a terrible thought to think. Especially by a child. Every time it came across my mind there were two outcomes. In one case I just quickly rejected the thought and tossed it aside, continuing my previous work.</description>

      <description>Music is a very powerful tool. It is the universal language that communicates to all people no matter of their race or beliefs. It provokes the mind and soul, and sets the imagination free. From a musician’s perspective, music is also a away to express yourself on a higher level. Depending on the mindset of a certain musician having no rules in music can be the biggest freedom or the hardest constraint.</description>

      <title>Because it’s hard</title>

      <description>Leaving the country that you were born in is difficult. The older you are, the more difficult it gets. I made the decision at a stage of my life when it was in place. High education degree, decent job, nice apartment, plenty of hobbies and social contacts. Most importantly I had the loving family, friends and soul mate that every person needs.
I already had what an average person seeks/wants/gets in the best case.</description>
